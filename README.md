# TT-Occ: Test-Time Compute for Self-Supervised Occupancy
Why train a dedicated occupancy network in the era of foundation VLMs?
We show that a test-time occupancy framework that integreted with a conmbination of VLMs could achieve SOTA performance **without any training or fine-tuning**.

## üì• Data Preparation

1. Download the nuScenes dataset from [nuScenes.org](https://www.nuscenes.org/download).
2. Extract nuScenes data into a readable format:
   ```bash
   python extract_nuscenes.py  # Ensure you set your dataset path inside this script.
   ```
3. Download ground-truth occupancy labels:
   * Occ3D-nuScenes GT: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Xarc91cNCNN3h8Vum-REbI-f0UlSf5Fc)
   * nuCraft GT: [nuCraft GitHub](https://github.com/V2AI/nuCraft_API?tab=readme-ov-file)
4. Update dataset paths in all `run_xx.sh`.

## üå± Environment Setup
For the external repositories used in this project, we provide minimal versions of their codebases under the `submodule` directory. These have been packaged and installed within a unified conda environment, so you do not need to clone or install each dependency separately. Please reproduce our environment and download checkpoints via:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate ttocc
bash submodules/install_and_download.sh
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Special Case:**
Due to dependency conflicts, **OpenSeeD** requires a separate environment.
Follow instructions at [OpenSeeD Installation Guide](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/OpenSeeD).

## üîß Data Preprocessing

Extract semantic features with OpenSeeD:

```bash
conda activate openseed
bash run_openseed.sh 
```

This generates `openseed_x` directories under your data folder.

**Optional (Recommended for TT-OccCamera):**
Pre-compute depth and optical flow to reduce GPU usage and loading time at runtime:

```bash
conda activate ttocc
bash run_vggt.sh
bash run_raft.sh
```

These scripts generate `vggt_x` and `raft_x` folders under the data directory.
If skipped, depth and flow are computed at runtime by calling VLM modules (requires more GPU memory).

## üöÄ Running TT-Occ

Evaluate on the complete 150-scene test split for both Occ3D-nuScenes and nuCraft:

```bash
conda activate ttocc
bash run_main.sh
```

Results will be saved to `out-main-xx` folders and summarized in `result.json`, matching paper-reported metrics.

### üé® Visualization

We provide a simple occupancy visualizer based on **Open3D**.
To visualize occupancy predictions, run:

```bash
python vis.py  # Make sure the dataset path is correctly set.
```

Example visualization outputs:

## üìå Acknowledgements

This project builds upon the excellent codebase of [3DGS](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting) and powerful VLMs including [OpenSeeD](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/OpenSeeD), [VGGT](https://github.com/facebookresearch/vggt), [RAFT](https://github.com/princeton-vl/RAFT), etc.
We deeply appreciate their creators' efforts and your interest in TT-Occ!
